                    <h2>A pleasant one and a half hour drive south east of Auckland takes you to the beautiful Coromandel Peninsula. Boasting some of New Zealand's most picturesque beaches, native Pohutukawa trees and rainforest, the Coromandel is a feast for the eyes.</h2>
					</hgroup>
               <p>The Coromandel's main attraction is its beauty and variety. Dense rainforest, endless bush walks, secluded beaches of white sand, coves and harbours all combine to make this a highly desirable destination. Thames, known as the ‘Gateway to the Coromandel’ in the southwest, is the main regional centre and has a long history of gold and silver mining. The Thames coastline is lined with many native Pohutakawa trees.</p>
               
               <p>In the northeast, Mercury Bay offers a spectacular coast flanked by islands. Whitianga, the area's main settlement, offers excellent fishing, beach/bushwalks, countless coves and beaches. Two well-known beaches, Cathedral Cove and Hot Water Beach are an absolute must-see. Hot Water beach is named after the thermal springs which bubble up through the sand making it possible to dig your own spa pool.</p>
