                    <h2>The east coast is best known for its high annual 
  sunshine hours, long established vineyards, many orchards and an atmosphere 
  of pure relaxation. The east coast is made up of three parts. East Cape, 
Poverty Bay and Hawke's bay. Each area has its own distinct landscape.</h2>
					</hgroup>
               <p>East Cape in the north is predominantly mountainous and its sparse population is located mainly along the coastline. Further inland, rugged bush-covered hills dominate the landscape. Gisborne is the east cape's main service centre and offers lots of sunnu weather, great surfing and countless vineyards. Gisborne has a high Maori population and offers many surviving examples of native architecture. One such place is at the foot of Titirangi hill where Te Poho-o-Rawiri (a large Maori meeting house) is located. Further south, the Te Urewera National Park contains the largest forested wilderness remaining in the North Island.</p>
                                
                <p>The city of Hastings offers Spanish Mission-style architecture and a diverse range of cultural attractions including the Hawkes Bay Exhibition Centre. It's inner city square is a popular venue for community events and is home to a large display of public art works. The city of Napier is renowned for its 1930s Art Deco architecture, Norfolk Pine tree-lined marine parade, great local wineries and fresh produce.</p>
