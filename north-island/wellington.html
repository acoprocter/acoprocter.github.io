                    <h2>Described as a village with skyscrapers, Wellington is New Zealand's capital offering an unforgettable city experience. Located between a beautiful harbour and towering green hills, Wellington will surprise you with its cultural richness and vibrant atmosphere.</h2>
					</hgroup>
               <p>Wellington lays claim to being New Zealand's cultural capital. The city is home to the magnificent national museum, <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/">Te Papa</a>. A huge building with literally too much to see in one day. </p>
                
                  <img src="images/pic-wellington2.jpg" alt="Te Papa" class="feature-right" />                
                                  
                <p>Other cultural attractions in the capital include a large selection of performing arts (Theatre, Opera and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra). Another significant place to visit is the Archives New Zealand building (where New Zealand's founding document, <a href="http://archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/treaty">the Treaty of Waitangi</a>, is located).</p>
                <p>Whether you enjoy a leisurely-paced stroll along the beautiful coastline or an energy-sapping day of shopping, Wellington will accommodate your needs - and some.</p>
