               <p>New Plymouth is Taranaki's only city and is well regarded for its beautiful parks, gardens, great surfing beaches as well as being close to the region's most famous landmark,  Mount Taranaki. Standing at over 2500 metres tall and snow covered most of the year, it bears a striking resemblance to Japan's Mt Fuji. </p>
               <p>Wanganui city is located 2 hours south of New Plymouth and lies at the mouth of New Zealand's longest navigable river, the majestic Whanganui. Palmerston North  is one of the country's most populated provincial centres and is home to NZ's largest agricultural university, Massey University. </p>
