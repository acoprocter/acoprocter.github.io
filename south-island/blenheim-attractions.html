                <p>A tour of Blenheim's many world-class vineyards and wineries is a must. Wine Tours by Bike offers self-guided tours to most of the popular vineyards - hire a bike for a few hours or the whole day. Of the fully guided tour options available, we recommend either Explore Marlborough or Marlborough Wine Tours (who also offer boat cruises in the Marlborough Sounds). Of the many vineyards Blenheim has to offer, we recommend visiting Highfield Estate Winery where you can enjoy fine wine with great food  in their in-house Restaurant. Other tourist attractions include Driftwood Eco-tours, which offers tours for bird-lovers to the Wairau Lagoon.</p>
