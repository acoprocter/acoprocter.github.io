                    <h2>Oamaru offers a refreshing blend of historic charm and hidden treasures. Boasting a vibrant Historic town centre that features New Zealand's best 19th Century streetscape plus a world famous  Blue Penguin Colony, Oamaru is  not to be missed. </h2>
					</hgroup>

<p>Oamaru is internationally renowned for its  neo-classical buildings crafted from locally quarried Oamaru Stone. The nearby harbour is recognised as a site of national significance by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust and is also home to the Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony. About a half-hour drive south of Oamaru  is the small fishing settlement of Moeraki where the famous Moeraki boulders are situated. Huge, completely round, smooth rocks sit in the beach like giant bowling balls. These boulders are the largest, most spherical and densely populated in the world.</p>

<p>North west of Oamaru, Waitaki Valley is home to New Zealand's largest braided river, the Waitaki River sourced from  the snowy peaks of  the Southern Alps. The valley boasts picturesque, man-made lakes  that are part of a complex hydro-electric dam system. The drive from Oamaru  to the head of the valley takes you through stunning sweeping vistas of snow capped mountains and deep blue lakes.</p>
