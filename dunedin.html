					<p>While visiting Dunedin, make sure you don't miss a trip to the picturesque Otago Peninsula. Stretching nearly 20 km from the city, the Peninsula is home to many of New Zealand's most 
					treasured bird and sea life including the Yellow - eyed Penguin, fur Seals and the Royal Albatross. Along with the wild life, there are great walks that take you to  many beautiful beaches situated along the Peninsula's rugged coastline.   </p>
