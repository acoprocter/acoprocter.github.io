<p><strong>Invercargill</strong><br />
          Southland's largest city, Invercargill is New Zealand's southern-most urban centre with a population of over 50,000 and serves as both support for the surrounding rural community and access to the popular Stewart Island.   </p>
        
        <p><strong>Gore and the Plains</strong><br />
          Situated on the banks of the Mataura river, Gore is Southland's second largest town. It is also one of the wealthiest urban centres in New Zealand, serving the rich agricultural hinterland. The Gore area is also regarded by many as a Trout fisherman's paradise.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Bluff</strong><br />
          One of the South Island's most southern settlements, Bluff is Invercargill's port town and gateway to <a href="stewart-island.html">Stewart Island</a>. Approximately 15 minutes drive south of Invercargill, Bluff is famous for its fishing industry, delicious oysters and great hospitality.</p>

        <p align="left"><strong>The Catlins</strong><br />
In North-eastern Southland (and South-eastern Otago), the Catlins is one of New Zealand's best kept secrets offering a vast array of wild, wind-swept vistas, beautiful virgin beaches, hilly farmland and temperate rainforest.</p>
