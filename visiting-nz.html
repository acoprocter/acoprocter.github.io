					<p id="when"><strong>When is the best time to visit New Zealand?</strong><br>
New Zealand is beautiful no matter what time of the year or season you visit. The best time to visit New Zealand is the time that suits you best. However, if you have more than one date in mind, the following information may help with your travel plans.
The warmest months of the year are from September through to April. 
December, January and February are the three hottest months of the year (Summer). Spring is from September - November. Autumn (fall) is from March - May and the Winter season runs from June - August. Maximum daytime temperatures vary from 15 to 30+ degrees (Celcius) in the Summer, 10 to 25 degrees in the Autumn (& Spring) and 5 to 18 degrees in the Winter. Weather forecasts and historical weather pattern information can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.metservice.com/">Metservice website</a>.</p>

<p id="busyseason"><strong>When is the busy tourist season in New Zealand?</strong><br>
The busiest season for tourism in New Zealand is during the southern hemisphere Summer period which runs from December through until the end of February. The main cities usually have vacancy during the busy season. However, in the popular holiday tourist towns of Nelson, Wanaka, Rotorua, Taupo, Hanmer Springs, Mount Maunganui and Queenstown, accommodation can be difficult to find unless booked well in advance. Other busy times of the year include the long Easter holiday weekend and during the other three School holiday periods which fall in the middle of April, mid-July and late September/Early October. During the ski-season (which runs from Early July until late September), accommodation should be booked well in advance in the winter resort towns of Queenstown, Wanaka, Methven, Ohakune and Taupo. For more information about School holiday dates, see the <a href="http://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/school-terms-and-holidays/">Ministry of Education</a> website.</p>

<p id="license"><strong>Can I drive in New Zealand?</strong><br>
In general, you can drive in New Zealand if you hold a current (valid) driver licence from another country or an international driving permit. If your licence is in a language other than English, an accurate translation is required. Your overseas or International driver licence is valid in New Zealand for up to 12 months. 
For information about driving in New Zealand, <a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/driver-licences/new-residents-and-visitors/driving-on-nz-roads/">click here</a>.</p>
 
<p id="visa"><strong>Do I need a visa to visit New Zealand?</strong><br>
If you are a citizen of a country that has a visa waiver agreement with New Zealand, you do not need to apply for a visitor visa (if your visit is for three months or less). For more information about visitor visa requirements including which countries are on visa-waiver list, see the <a href="https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/options/visit">Immigration NZ website</a>.</p>

<p id="more_info"><strong>Where can I find General Information about New Zealand? </strong><br>

<p id="gettonz"><strong>How do I get to New Zealand?</strong><br>

<p id="currency"><strong>What currency is used in NZ?</strong><br>
The New Zealand Dollar ($NZ). 
For current exchange rates, use this <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/">currency converter</a>.</p>


<p id="money"><strong>How much money should I bring to New Zealand?</strong><br>
There are hundreds of ATM machines throughout New Zealand that will enable you to draw funds from your bank account in your country as well as point-of-sale facilities that allow you to purchase items directly using your credit card. Therefore, bringing loads of cash with you is not necessary. How much? It really depends on how long you will be here for, what you plan to do and, of course, the level of accommodation you require. Seeing New Zealand with a pack on your back will cost you upwards of NZ$140+ per day (excluding sightseeing expenses). 4 star Accommodation ranges from NZ$180 - $350+ per room per night depending on the time of year. Luxury Hotels & Lodges cost anywhere from $300 - $2000+ per night.</p>
