					<h1>Hawke's Bay Attractions</h1>
                    
					</hgroup>
                <p>There are plenty of great tourist attractions in Hawke's Bay  to choose from. A visit to one of the region's famous wineries  should be high on your list of things to do. On Yer Bike offers Winery Tours by bike where you can experience some of Hawkes Bay's finest wines and  also enjoy the stunning scenery along the way. Of the cultural attractions, we recommend visiting the Hawke's bay Museum and Art Gallery, or join a tour with Long Island Tours who offer a wide range of personally guided experiences. The National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier is also well worth a visit. If you have half a day to spare, we highly recommend experiencing the world's largest most accessible mainland colony of Gannets at Cape Kidnappers.</p>
